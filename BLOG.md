# How Can I Wordle Out of Real Work?

Let me start this with a confession:

> I don't (technically) play Wordle

This is very important, as recently my wife came to me and proclaimed "I just got a magnificent in Wordle" (the blank look on my face definitely bumped up my heating bill for a few days).  When I asked my daughter if she played it, she pointed me to [Word Master](https://octokatherine.github.io/word-master/) and I was hooked.

Many discussions (with my daughter -- my wife had no interest in our flagrant disrespect of Wordle) ensued about best words to start.  For the longest, mine were `train`, `speck`, `dough`.  You see, our philosophy was to bank out 2-3 words and get the letters, then stress over guessing the word after establishing a good bank of letters.  I searched online for the best 3 letters, but nobody seemed to follow this technique.  So, off I went to figure it out.

But first, take another look at `octokatherine`'s creation:  Open source, hosted in github, quite a few contributors, pull-requests, issues.  Wow, just wow. 

The idea of a blog post started in the idle thought of "How would you determine the top 3 best words to start with?".  Then it spiraled into thoughts of recursion (determine the best first work, then all the best second words, etc).  I then realized that I needed to jump into it and start this because I was going to obsess about it in my head until I did.
